# Spatial modelling of malaria in lake region counties of Kenya using pymc library in Python
* Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease caused by any one of four closely related dengue viruses.  Dengue fever is transmitted through the bite of an aedes mosquito infected with a dengue virus. Mosquitos become infected when it bites a person with dengue virus in their blood. However, dengue fever canâ€™t be spread directly from one person to another person.
* Approximately 400 million people worldwide are infected with dengue virus each year, and 100 million become mildly to severely ill with dengue fever. Most cases happen in tropical areas, such as Southeast Asia, the western Pacific islands, Latin America, and Africa.
* Here, we develope a Bayesian spatial model to predict dengue fever prevalence at unsampled locations and quantify the effect of each of the covariates on dengue fever prevalence in the western parts of Kenya using replication data for manuscript "Serological and spatial analysis of alphavirus and flavivirus prevalence and risk factors in a rural community in western Kenya" (https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005998)
