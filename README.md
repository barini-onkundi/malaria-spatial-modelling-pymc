# Spatial modelling of malaria in lake region counties of Kenya using pymc library in Python
*Malaria remains a major public health challenge in Kenya, particularly in the Lake Region counties‚Äîincluding Kisumu, Homa Bay, Siaya, and Migori‚Äîwhere the disease is endemic due to favorable ecological conditions for Anopheles mosquitoes. Malaria is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito, which acquires the Plasmodium parasite by feeding on an infected person. Unlike some diseases, malaria cannot be spread directly from person to person.

This repository presents a Bayesian spatial modeling framework to estimate malaria prevalence across the Lake Region of Kenya, including locations where survey data is not directly available. The model quantifies spatial variation and assesses the influence of covariates such as climate, elevation, and population density on malaria transmission.

üîç Objective
To predict malaria prevalence at unsampled locations and quantify the effects of key environmental and demographic predictors using a Bayesian geostatistical approach.
