## ðŸ“Š Posterior Inference & Predictions

- Posterior samples are obtained using `pm.sample()` in PyMC with appropriate tuning and convergence checks.
- Prediction surfaces (mean and credible intervals) are generated on a uniform grid using the fitted model.
- In-sample fit is assessed using RMSE and posterior predictive checks.
