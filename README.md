# Spatial Modeling of Malaria Prevalence Modeling in Western Endemic Zone of Kenya

Malaria continues to pose a significant public health burden in Kenya, with the western and coastal regions bearing a disproportionate share of the disease burden (https://www.severemalaria.org/statistics-facts-by-country/kenya). According to 2020 Kenya Malaria Indicator Survey, the Lake endemic region consisting of Kisumu, Homa Bay, Siaya, Busia, Vihiga, Bungoma and Migori recorded a prevalence ranging between 11% and 19% (https://statistics.knbs.or.ke/nada/index.php/catalog/111). Year-round transmission in these areas is sustained by ecological conditions that favor the survival and breeding of *Anopheles* mosquitoes. This project applies a Bayesian geostatistical framework to model malaria prevalence using environmental predictors. 

> **Goal**: Estimate malaria prevalence at unsampled locations by leveraging environmental and demographic factors through a fully Bayesian spatial model implemented in Python using PyMC.

## Objectives

- Estimate malaria prevalence at locations without survey data.
- Quantify the spatial heterogeneity of transmission using a spatial random field.
- Apply an efficient **Hilbert Space Gaussian Process (HSGP)** prior to enable scalable spatial modeling.
- Generate prediction surfaces with uncertainty quantification using satellite derived covariates.

## Methodology

### Model specification

We're using a **binomial likelihood model** to analyze malaria prevalence. For each location $i$, the observed number of positive cases, $Y_i$, is modeled as:

$$Y_i \sim \text{Binomial}(n_i, P(x_i))$$

Here, $n_i$ represents the total number of individuals tested for malaria at location $x_i$, and $P(x_i)$ is the underlying prevalence of malaria at that specific location.

---

To link the prevalence $P(x_i)$ to our covariates, we use a logit link function:

$$\text{logit}(P(x_i)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{evi} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{temp} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{precip} + \beta_4 \cdot \text{dist} + \beta_5 \cdot \text{elev} + \beta_6 \cdot \text{net} + \beta_7 \cdot \text{pop} + S(x_i)$$

---

In this equation:
* $\beta_0$ is the **intercept**.
* $\beta_1, \dots, \beta_7$ are the **coefficients** for the environmental and demographic covariates, which include Enhanced Vegetation Index ($\text{evi}$), temperature ($\text{temp}$), precipitation ($\text{precip}$), distance to nearest health facility ($\text{dist}$), elevation ($\text{elev}$), net usage ($\text{net}$), and population density ($\text{pop}$).
* $S(x_i)$ is a **zero-mean Gaussian Process** with a Mat√©rn covariance function ($\nu=3/2$). We'll approximate this spatial effect using a **Hilbert Space Gaussian Process (HSGP)** to efficiently capture geographical correlation.

## Posterior Inference & Predictions

- Posterior samples are obtained using `pm.sample()` in PyMC with appropriate tuning and convergence checks.
- Prediction surfaces (mean and credible intervals) are generated on a uniform grid using the fitted model.
- In-sample fit is assessed using RMSE and posterior predictive checks.
