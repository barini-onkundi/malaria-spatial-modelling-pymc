# Spatial Modeling of Malaria in Kenya‚Äôs Lake Region Using Bayesian Geostatistics (PyMC)

Malaria continues to pose a significant public health burden in Kenya, with the western and coastal regions bearing a disproportionate share of the disease burden (https://www.severemalaria.org/statistics-facts-by-country/kenya). According to 2020 Kenya Malaria Indicator Survey, the Lake endemic region consisting of Kisumu, Homa Bay, Siaya, Busia, Vihiga, Bungoma and Migori recorded a prevalence ranging between 11% and 19% (https://statistics.knbs.or.ke/nada/index.php/catalog/111). Year-round transmission in these areas is sustained by ecological conditions that favor the survival and breeding of *Anopheles* mosquitoes. This project applies a Bayesian geostatistical framework to model malaria prevalence using environmental predictors. 

> **Goal**: Estimate malaria prevalence at unsampled locations by leveraging environmental and demographic factors through a fully Bayesian spatial model implemented in Python using PyMC.

## Objectives

- Estimate malaria prevalence at locations without survey data.
- Quantify the spatial heterogeneity of transmission using a spatial random field.
- Apply an efficient **Hilbert Space Gaussian Process (HSGP)** prior to enable scalable spatial modeling.
- Generate prediction surfaces with uncertainty quantification using satellite derived covariates.

## Methodology

### Model specification

The Bayesian model is built using `PyMC`, with the following key components:

- **Response**: Number of malaria-positive individuals per survey cluster.
- **n**: Total number of individuals tested pr survey cluster. 
- **Predictors**: Environmental covariates extracted from high-resolution raster data.
- **Spatial Effect**: Modeled using an HSGP prior with a Matern-3/2 kernel.
- **Link Function**: Logit link for modeling malaria prevalence.
- **Priors**: Weakly informative Gaussian priors on regression coefficients, Gamma prior on the GP length scale.

### Model Equation

Let $\ p_i \$ denote the malaria prevalence at location $\ i \$, and $\ s_i \$ be the spatial effect:

$\text{logit}p_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{EVI}_i + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Temp}_i + \dots + \beta_k \cdot X_{ik} + s_i\$


The likelihood is:

$\text{Pos}_i \sim \text{Binomial}(n_i, p_i)$

## Posterior Inference & Predictions

- Posterior samples are obtained using `pm.sample()` in PyMC with appropriate tuning and convergence checks.
- Prediction surfaces (mean and credible intervals) are generated on a uniform grid using the fitted model.
- In-sample fit is assessed using RMSE and posterior predictive checks.
